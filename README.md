# PWA Hello World

## What Is This Project

This is a tiny demo on how to create a progressive web app, ie. a web app that can be installed to the home screen. This repo holds the source code for the project. Its functionality is built in React, but there is also an install-button that exists outside of the React app.

The demo of the app is available here: https://rahulrakshit.com/pwa-hello-world.

I've tested the installation on Chrome and Firefox for Android and on Chrome for macOS.

## What Can It Do

The app can't do much. You can change the color of a div to a few different colors. But the point of the app is to demo installation of a web app on mobile and desktop.
